# Brainstorming Ideas
## About Me
> Hobby gamer, open source enthusiast.

As a kid I always enjoyed playing games. Strategy, Simulation and FPS used to be my go-to genres. With time progressing, I moved away from AAA titles, and became more inclined into relaxing games, and indie titles as a whole.

I don't have a "go-to" favourite game, since I would say it really depends on favourite game by genre. Some of my favourite games include:
- **Rimworld** - For its manipulability, modability, replayability and aspects of strategy.
- **Stronghold** - For its impressive design (at the time), replayability and aspects of strategy.
- **Life is Strange** - For its great story, choice and immersion.
- **The Last of Us** - For its great story, sound, execution and innovation in the game area.
- **Minecraft** - For its manipulability, modability, replayability and expandability years after the game has been released.
- **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** - For its world openness, inventory manipulability, legendary gunplay mechanics and climate.

Previously, I played around with Unity, Godot and UE development, but I realised that working on the whole pipeline of a game isn't for me. I always enjoyed working more with the technical side of code instead.

As for my other skills and projects, I currently maintain an open source plugin for Minecraft with 8241 cumulative downloads at present (as of 14/10/2024).
## Why Did I Choose this Module?
I chose this module primarily to utilise and learn more about low-level programming languages (C, C++ and Rust). Gaming is a hobby, but not necessarily a career goal, but rather a passion for me.

As part of this coursework I am aiming for something versatile to add onto my portfolio of projects in terms of skills. This means my primary aim is to deliver a ***technically impressive*** game, which affects my choice of game idea.
## Brainstorming Ideas
### Space Colony Simulator
**Genre**: `Strategy` / `Simulation`
**Brief**: Players manage a growing colony on a distant planet, balancing resource management, expansion, and defence against alien threats.
**Inspirations**: [Faster Than Light](https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/), [Rimworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/)

I have chosen **not** to use this game idea because:
- It may be relatively hard to fit certain mark scheme criteria into this idea.
### Retro Arcade Shooter
**Genre**: `Arcade` / `Shooter`
**Brief**: A top-down or side-scrolling shooter where players control a spaceship, fighting waves of alien invaders.
**Inspirations**: [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)

I have chosen **not** to use this game idea because:
- I have already created a retro game in the first year, and taking on this project wouldn't vary my portfolio to a wide extent.
- It may be relatively hard to fit certain mark scheme criteria into this idea.
- The idea seems overused, and there are plenty of similar games out there, potentially ending up not as impressive on a portfolio.
### Time-Traveling Puzzle Platformer
**Genre**: `Platformer` / `Puzzle`
**Brief**: Players navigate through different historical eras, solving puzzles and avoiding dangers by manipulating time and interacting with the environment.
**Inspirations**: [What Remains of Edith Finch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/501300/What_Remains_of_Edith_Finch/), [Life Is Strange](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/Life_is_Strange__Episode_1/), [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/)

I have chosen **not** to use this game idea because:
- In the limited time, it may not be feasible to create something impactful.
- This idea might require a lot of niche assets, which may be hard to find.
### Fortress Defence
**Genre**: `Tower Defense` / `Strategy`
**Brief**: Players use various magical spells and constructs to defend their fortress against waves of mythical creatures.
**Inspirations**: [Bloons TD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/960090/Bloons_TD_6/), [Age of War](https://ageofwargame.io/)

I have chosen **not** to use this game idea because:
- It seems like a basic and overused idea, and it might be hard to make a unique twist on it.
- It may be relatively hard to fit certain mark scheme criteria into this idea.
### City Builder
**Genre**: `Strategy` / `City-Building` / `Simulation`
**Brief**: Players build and manage a floating city in the sky, balancing resource management, construction, and defence against threats.
**Inspirations**: [Minecraft // The Aether Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/aether), [Rimworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/), [Stronghold](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140020/Stronghold_Definitive_Edition/) , [Starcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_(video_game)), [Manor Lords](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/)
### Rhythm Racer
**Genre**: `Racing` / `Rhythm`
**Brief**: A racing game where players move to the beat of the music, avoiding obstacles and collecting points.
**Inspirations**: [Need for Speed](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262540/Need_for_Speed/), [Beat Saber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/), [Osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

I have chosen **not** to use this game idea because:
- Finding fitting music under permissive licences may be challenging, taking focus away from technical development.
- The game will be playable, but less enticing without sound.
	- Presenting and demoing the project becomes difficult.
## Narrowing Down Choices
I have narrowed down my choices, as written above, and their respective reasons why I've not proceeded with them.

I personally think a more relaxed city builder game fits with my current gaming style. Something I enjoy, means I will be more likely to see it through to the end and develop in full. The game, should also present enough opportunity to surpass all outlined requirements for a high grade. As a whole, the project should be an impressive addition to my portfolio, and potentially even something I can list for free on steam just for the sake of getting statistics and user base.
