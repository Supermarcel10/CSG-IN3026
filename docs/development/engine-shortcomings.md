# Engine Shortcomings

## Compiling Difficulties
The current setup of the engine and template project makes it very difficult to compile using different IDEs and operating systems.

As part of this module, my undertaking will be to resolve this, so I can utilise JetBrains CLion and Nvim as my primary development IDEs. This solution can also be my technical contribution to update the engine template.
## Linux & Mac Support
Currently, the biggest downfall of the engine is the lack of support for Unix based systems.

As part of this module, I will find a workaround to allow compiling code on any architecture and machine if possible. This will allow for support of a wider number of devices. This solution can also be my technical contribution to update the engine template.
